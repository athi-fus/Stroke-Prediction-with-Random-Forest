# Stroke-Prediction-with-Random-Forest
Python program for machine learning university project. Using the Random Forest classifier, we predict whether a patient is going to have a stroke or not. 

I used the healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv. Filled the missing values with various methods like, filling with the mean of the values of the column, using linear regression and using the k-means algorithm.
